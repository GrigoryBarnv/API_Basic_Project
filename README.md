# Bundesliga Data Explorer (Python)

This interactive data analysis project is built using Python, leveraging the OpenLigaDB API to explore and visualize football data from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd German Bundesliga leagues. It demonstrates the ability to combine real-time API integration, interactive widgets, statistical analysis, and geospatial visualization in a clear and user-focused interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook
- requests, matplotlib, folium, ipywidgets, pandas

## Key Features
